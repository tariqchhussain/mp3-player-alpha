# mp3-player-alpha
My first major Python project, built on tkinter and pyglet, with dearpygui as the GUI.

### Current features:

* Play and pause music files (of course)
* Ability to locate and play two music files (not sequentially) and skip between them, but not vice versa.
* Ability to see current duration
* Ability to see the filepath of the currently playing music file (only the first one at the moment).

### Features to add:

(Some are commented at the end of the main script, but more detailed ones will be posted here)

* UI improvements such as formatting, colour scheme etc.
* Ability to switch between music files (i.e. move back and forth)
* Have the filepath update in the UI when the music file changes
* Add more than two music files to the queue (playlists?)
* Seek and rewind tracks incrementally (i.e. 5, 10, or 20 seconds)
* Other QoL fixes

### Changelog:
(coming soon)
